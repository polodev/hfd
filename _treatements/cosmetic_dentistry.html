</p>
<p>
Sometimes the natural contours of the gums are uneven and unsymmetrical producing an unaesthetic smile. Such gums are recontoured to make them look more pleasing and aesthetic. 
</p>


<h3 class="hfd_color">E.	Replacement of 'black- line '/artificial looking crowns</h3>

<p>
The crowns used for the anterior teeth were mostly ceramic fused to metal crowns, with a metal base coated by ceramic.  One of the major drawbacks of such crowns is the unsightly black metal line seen along the border of the crown along with a mild metallic tint to the overall crown.  At Haris Family Dentistry, metal free ceramic / zirconium crowns are used for anterior teeth.
