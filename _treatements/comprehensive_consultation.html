	The first appointment of a consultation / examination is a very important process before initiating any dental procedure.  After a thorough evaluation of your oral health, the doctors would explain the same to you and formulated an ideal treatment plan for your case. The time required for the completion of the treatment and the exact fee estimate would be clarified during this appointment.

	Various alternative treatment plans would be given to you as well as to suit your budget and time constraints if any. All your doubts and queries would be solved by the doctor at this stage and this first appointment serves as a platform for a healthy doctor -patient relationship.

	After this appointment, you can choose to proceed with the further treatment only if you feel comfortable as there are no obligations for the same. Only a one time consultation fee would be charged.
