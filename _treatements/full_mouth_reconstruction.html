<p>
Full mouth reconstructions (rehabilitations) are needed when the oral health as a whole has deteriorated due to multiple dental problems. As complex as it may seem, such cases can be treated to produce flawless results and restore the oral function back to normal if the treatment is planned well and executed by Haris Family Dentistry.

<p>
While planning such cases numerous factors are taken into consideration such as the patientâ€™s primary and secondary problems, their expectations, their existing medical and oral condition and of course their time and budget constraints if any to arrive at the most practical treatment plan for a particular case.
