Orthodontic treatment improve aesthetic, corrects teeth that don’t line up correctly (“bad bites), helping to improve oral health and enhance your smile.

Orthodontic treatment realigns teeth by applying constant, gentle pressure. This was typically done with metal brace. Small brackets cemented to the teeth were connected by a wire, which was regularly tightened by a dentist or orthodontist to shift teeth into the desired position.
