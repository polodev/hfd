Breakthroughs in modern dentistry now allow for what are called flexible removable partial dentures (RPD's) that are flexible and more esthetically pleasing than more traditional denture. These partial dentures are a great alternative for patients who prefer to wear a removable denture rather than a fixed restoration such as a dental bridge or dental implant.The flexible base of the appliance adapts to the constant movement and flexibility in the mouth. </p>
