Dental implants are an ideal choice for the replacement of missing teeth (unless contraindicated). A number of implant systems are used at Haris Family Dentistry, such as the Noble Biocare system, Osstem system.

Successful replacement of teeth with implants is an extremely 'technique sensitive' process, requiring great expertise.  An advanced titanium structure is anchored into the where the tooth to be replaced. This structure acts like a support for the crown or the artificial tooth. These mechanics are exactly similar to how a natural tooth anchors itself and therefore, dental implants are the ideal replacement solution.

	Benefits of dental implants: 
</h3>
<ul>

<li>Keeping the 3 most important factors of form, function and aesthetics in mind, dental implants are the  ideal solution for replacement of natural teeth.</li>
 
<li>The ability to bite into and chew foods just like natural teeth is gained.  You can enjoy your favorite foods such as meats and nuts, as if you were using healthy, natural teeth.</li>


<li>Instantly reverse age. With missing teeth, the face has a sunken appearance and a person looks much older than he or she actually is.  With dental implants, this is reversed immediately and a well balanced, natural and radiant smile gained. This process alone would make one look at least 20 years younger! </li>

<li>Dental implants are a one time procedure. Once done, they last a lifetime.</li>

	Implants time frame: 
</h3>
<p><strong>Depending on the technology used, implants at Haris Family Dentistry are categorized into 3 types, based on the time required:</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Two stage implants: </strong>
	the procedure is carried out in two stages spread over a minimum interval of 3 months.  The first stage involves the placement of the implants and requires one or two sessions. The second stage involves the fabrication of the crowns.  This is an obsolete technology and only used in those few cases where single implants are clinically not possible.
</p> 
<p>
	<strong> Single stage implants: </strong>
	the latest in dental implant technology, this involves completion of the entire procedure, right from extractions, implant placements and fabrication of the crowns (teeth) in one stage of approximately two weeks. This system can be used for almost all types and categories of cases. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong> Immediate implants: </strong>
	this is a specialized technique, allowing teeth to be replaced in a single day. Most cases are eligible for this technique; however, scans and evaluation are required to confirm this. This system is a revolutionary concept that combines precision surgery with specialized implants for immediate results.
