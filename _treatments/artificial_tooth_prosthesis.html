<p> Crowns are an ideal way to rebuild teeth which have been broken, or which have been weakened by decay or a very large filling. </p>
<p>
	The crown fits over the remaining part of the tooth, making it strong and giving it the shape and the contour of a natural tooth.

<p>
	Bridges (which are a number of units of crowns attached to one another) are used for the replacement of missing teeth. Artificial tints are deliberately incorporated in the ceramic to match the natural shade of the adjacent teeth. 
</p>
<p class='mark'>
There are many unfavorable consequences from loss of teeth without replacement:
</p>
<!-- /.mark -->

<ul>
	<li>

	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Difficulty in chewing:</strong>
		 Missing teeth causes issues in chewing that could possibly result in indigestion 
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Poor appearance and bone loss: </strong>

	</li>
	<li>
