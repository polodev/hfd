          <p>Rush the injured person and tooth to the dental office. Place and transport the tooth in milk or in some of the person’s own saliva. Ideally the tooth will be re-implanted. The tooth may also be splinted with a wire to the adjacent teeth for a period of time. </p>
          <p>This is a true dental emergency. If it is after regular business hours you should still call your dentist. The more time that goes by the less likely that the re-implantation will be successful. </p>

What should I do if I have a dental emergency and can't get a hold of my dentist?

          <p>If you can’t reach any dentist, here are some helpful tips:</p>
          <h3>Toothache:</h3>
          <p> Rinse your mouth with warm salt water. Gently brush and floss the area to remove any trapped food or debris. If you can take over the counter pain medications (such as Paracetamol) they may help in soothing the pain. Make arrangements to see your dentist even if the pain goes.  Without proper care your condition could return or even worsen. </p>
          <h3>When a permanent (or temporary) crown comes off: </h3>
          <p>Keep the area clean by rinsing with warm salt water rinses and by gently brushing the area if it is not too sensitive. If the tooth is painful, denture cream or toothpaste can be placed inside the crown and it can be gently fit back into place.</p>
          <p>Depending on the location of the missing tooth, we would most likely recommend either a dental implant, a bridge, or a partial denture. All of these options have their benefits and drawbacks. If you would like more information we can schedule a consultation to go over the specifics of your case.</p>
